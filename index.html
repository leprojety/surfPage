                In recent years, astrochemistry has seen remarkable advancements driven by cutting-edge telescopes like ALMA and JWST, which have enabled the detection of increasingly complex molecules in protoplanetary disks, molecular clouds, and other galaxies. These observations underscore the importance of understanding the chemical processes that occur in these regions. However, simulating these intricate environments presents a significant challenge due to the computational demands of integrating both hydrodynamics (physics) and astrochemical models (chemistry).
                <br><br>
                To address this challenge, the Hydrodynamical Astrochemical Autochemulators for Simulations (HAAS) project uses Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs) to emulate (surrogate modeling) astrochemical simulations. Novel datasets of this project include simulation results of the photodissociation region (PDR) in the Orion Bar. HAAS aims to investigate and benchmark fast and robust emulators that can be included as preconditioners of classical codes or full emulators into 3D simulations.
                <br><br>
                The project is aims to be a collaborative effort between the astrochemistry and machine learning communities, with a focus on developing a comprehensive library of ML models tailored to astrochemical emulation. By integrating these models into hydrodynamical simulations, HAAS aspires to enable high-resolution studies that could shed light on the origins of life and deepen our understanding of chemistry in space.
                <br><br>
                A haas is a hare in Dutch, making it a proper acronym for a project trying to accelerate astrochemistry.
