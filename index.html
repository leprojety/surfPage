                In recent years, astrochemistry has seen remarkable advancements driven by cutting-edge telescopes like ALMA and JWST, which have enabled the detection of increasingly complex molecules in protoplanetary disks, molecular clouds, and other galaxies. These observations underscore the importance of understanding the chemical processes that occur in these regions. However, simulating these intricate environments presents a significant challenge due to the computational demands of integrating both hydrodynamics (physics) and astrochemical models (chemistry).
                <br><br>
                To address this challenge, the Hydrodynamical Astrochemical Autochemulators for Simulations (HAAS) project uses Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs) to emulate (surrogate modeling) astrochemical simulations. Novel datasets of this project include simulation results of the photodissociation region (PDR) in the Orion Bar. HAAS aims to investigate and benchmark fast and robust emulators that can be included as preconditioners of classical codes or full emulators into 3D simulations.
                <br><br>
                The project is aims to be a collaborative effort between the astrochemistry and machine learning communities, with a focus on developing a comprehensive library of ML models tailored to astrochemical emulation. By integrating these models into hydrodynamical simulations, HAAS aspires to enable high-resolution studies that could shed light on the origins of life and deepen our understanding of chemistry in space.

                A haas is a hare in Dutch, making it a proper acronym for a project trying to accelerate astrochemistry.

                The large-scale structure of the universe is shaped by the gravitational evolution of dark matter, forming a vast cosmic web of filaments, voids, galaxy clusters, and halos. Cosmological N-body simulations play a crucial role in analyzing large-scale galaxy surveys collected from telescopes by providing predictions for the clustering of dark matter and galaxies. However, running these simulations requires intensive computational resources, limiting the number of model configurations that can be explored. As a result, they struggle to keep pace with the growing volume of observed data.

                In this work, we investigate the use of score-based generative machine learning models to learn the distribution of dark matter across different cosmological parameter configurations. Our approach uses a graph neural network with message-passing layers to capture meaningful topological features in dark matter halos represented as point clouds. To train the network, we add varying levels of random noise to the data and learn to predict the score, which points in the direction of increasing data density. During sampling, we begin from a uniform prior distribution that lacks structure and iteratively refine the data using Langevin Dynamics to recover the dark matter distribution.

                Two notable challenges of this project are the large sizes of the point clouds and the domain-specific constraints. Since point clouds contain up to 600,000 points, directly processing them is memory demanding. To address this, we construct subgraphs that reduce the memory demand while preserving local structure of the data. Additionally, because periodic boundary conditions affect how distances and neighborhoods are computed and therefore how points move, we integrate them at every stage of the model pipeline, including k-NN computation, data perturbation, and inference, ensuring consistency with the data properties.
